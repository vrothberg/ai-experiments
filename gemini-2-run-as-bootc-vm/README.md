## PROMPT: "Look at the attached Containerfile and give me instructions how to run it as a bootc VM."

Comments are marked with a :warning:.

To run the provided `Containerfile` as a bootc VM, you'll need to follow these general steps:

**1. Build the Container Image:**

First, you need to build a container image from your `Containerfile`. [cite: 1]

* Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your `Containerfile` is saved.
* Run the following command, replacing `your-image-name:tag` with a name and tag for your image (e.g., `my-rhel-bootc-httpd:latest`):

**:warning: THIS SHOULD RUN AS ROOT FOR COMMANDS BELOW TO WORK**

    ```bash
    podman build -f Containerfile.txt -t your-image-name:tag .
    ```
    (The `-f Containerfile.txt` specifies the filename if it's not the default "Containerfile".)

**2. Convert the Container Image to a Bootable Disk Image (QCOW2):**

Next, you will use the `bootc-image-builder` tool to convert the container image you just built into a bootable disk image format, such as QCOW2 (which is commonly used with QEMU/KVM). [cite: 205, 206]

* Ensure you have `bootc-image-builder` available. It typically runs as a container itself. You might need to pull it first if you haven't:

    ```bash
    sudo podman pull registry.redhat.io/rhel9/bootc-image-builder:latest
    ```
    (This command is based on information for installing `bootc-image-builder` from the RHEL documentation. [cite: 192])
* Create an output directory where the disk image will be saved:

    ```bash
    mkdir ./output
    ```
* Run `bootc-image-builder`. You'll need to mount your local container storage so `bootc-image-builder` can find the image you built, and mount the output directory. [cite: 206]

    ```bash
    sudo podman run \
        --rm \
        -it \
        --privileged \
        --pull=newer \
        --security-opt label=type:unconfined_t \
        -v $(pwd)/output:/output \
        -v /var/lib/containers/storage:/var/lib/containers/storage \
        registry.redhat.io/rhel9/bootc-image-builder:latest \
        --type qcow2 \
        --local \
        your-image-name:tag
    ```

    * `--privileged` and `--security-opt label=type:unconfined_t` are often required for `bootc-image-builder` to perform tasks like creating disk images. [cite: 205, 206]
    * `-v $(pwd)/output:/output` maps your created output directory to the `/output` directory inside the container. [cite: 205, 206]
    * `-v /var/lib/containers/storage:/var/lib/containers/storage` allows the builder to access images from your local Podman storage. [cite: 206, 207]
    * `--type qcow2` specifies the desired output disk image format. [cite: 205, 207]
    * `--local` tells `bootc-image-builder` to look for the image in the mounted container storage rather than trying to pull it from a remote registry. [cite: 207]
    * `your-image-name:tag` is the name and tag of the image you built in step 1.

    After this command completes, you should find a `.qcow2` file in your `./output/qcow2/` directory. [cite: 208]

**3. Run the Disk Image as a VM:**

Finally, you can use a virtualization tool like `virt-install` (which uses libvirt and KVM/QEMU) to run the generated QCOW2 image as a virtual machine. [cite: 418]

* Ensure you have `virt-install` and related virtualization packages installed on your system. For RHEL/Fedora based systems, this typically involves installing packages like `virt-install`, `libvirt-daemon-kvm`, `qemu-kvm`.
* Run the VM using `virt-install`:

    ```bash
    sudo virt-install \
        --name my-bootc-vm \
        --memory 2048 \
        --vcpus 2 \
        --disk path=$(pwd)/output/qcow2/disk.qcow2,format=qcow2,bus=virtio \
        --import \
        --os-variant rhel9-unknown \
        --network network=default,model=virtio \
        --graphics vnc,listen=0.0.0.0 \
        --noautoconsole
    ```

    * `--name my-bootc-vm`: A name for your virtual machine.
    * `--memory 2048`: Allocate 2GB of RAM (adjust as needed).
    * `--vcpus 2`: Allocate 2 virtual CPUs (adjust as needed).
    * `--disk path=$(pwd)/output/qcow2/disk.qcow2...`: Specifies the path to your QCOW2 image. [cite: 418] The exact filename `disk.qcow2` is the default output from `bootc-image-builder`.
    * `--import`: Tells `virt-install` to import an existing disk image. [cite: 418]
    * `--os-variant rhel9-unknown`: Helps libvirt optimize the VM configuration for RHEL 9. [cite: 418] You might need to use a more specific variant if available (e.g., `rhel9.4`).
    * `--network network=default,model=virtio`: Configures networking (assumes a default libvirt network).
    * `--graphics vnc,listen=0.0.0.0`: Configures VNC access to the VM's console.
    * `--noautoconsole`: Prevents `virt-install` from automatically connecting to the console.

* You can then connect to your VM's console using a VNC client or use `virsh console my-bootc-vm` if serial console is correctly configured within the image (which is typical for server images).

These instructions provide a general workflow. You may need to adjust commands and parameters based on your specific environment and the configuration of your RHEL bootc image. Refer to the RHEL documentation "Using image mode for RHEL to build, deploy, and manage operating systems" for more detailed information.
